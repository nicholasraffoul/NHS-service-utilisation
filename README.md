# NHS Service Utilisation – Data Analysis Project

This repository presents a data exploration project focused on NHS appointment activity. The main objective is to investigate patterns in appointment types, regional trends, and missed (DNA) appointments, using a combination of visualisation and data wrangling techniques.

## Project Overview

This project was developed as part of a data analytics course to explore service utilisation in the NHS. It includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visual outputs that highlight key insights related to how different services are accessed and missed across the UK.

### Files and Folders

- `NHS-Data-Exploration-Jupyter-Notebook.ipynb` – Contains the full analysis process from import to insights.
- `data/` – Folder containing CSV and Excel files used in the project.
- `README.md` – This document.
- (Optional) `figures/` – Store for generated charts and plots.

## Goals of the Analysis

- Understand service demand across regions and categories.
- Identify trends in appointment attendance and DNA rates.
- Highlight seasonal patterns and monthly changes in service use.
- Use visual tools to communicate trends to a non-technical audience.

## Tools Used

- **Python** (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **SQL** (for advanced queries and joins)
- **Git & GitHub** (for version tracking and sharing)

## Summary of Findings

- DNA rates vary by service type, with certain categories (e.g. Mental Health) showing consistently high rates.
- Missed appointments are not distributed evenly throughout the year; some months show notable spikes.
- Visual comparisons of actual vs scheduled durations help identify inefficiencies or gaps in scheduling.

## Notes

- All datasets are stored locally in the `data/` folder.
- Outputs and figures can be generated by running the Jupyter Notebook from start to finish.
