# 🏥 NHS Service Utilisation Analysis

This repository contains the analysis and deliverables for a data analytics project exploring NHS service utilisation. The goal is to uncover patterns in appointment data and provide actionable insights to support improved healthcare delivery and reduce missed appointments (Did Not Attend – DNA rates).

## 📁 Project Structure

- `NHS-service-utilisation.ipynb` – Main Jupyter Notebook containing data cleaning, exploration, and visualisation.
- `data/` – Folder containing raw and cleaned data files.
- `figures/` – Plots and charts generated during the analysis.
- `README.md` – Project overview and documentation.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Explore how NHS services are used across various contexts and settings.
- Identify trends and spikes in DNA (Did Not Attend) appointments.
- Analyse service types and national category breakdowns.
- Provide visual evidence and summaries to guide NHS planning and resourcing.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Python** – Data analysis and visualisation
  - Libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Analysis environment
- **SQL** – Querying and joining relevant datasets
- **Git/GitHub** – Version control and collaboration

## 📊 Key Insights

- DNA appointment rates show seasonal variation and are higher in specific service settings.
- Certain appointment types (e.g., Mental Health) have consistently elevated DNA rates.
- Monthly totals and proportions help identify periods of service strain or under-utilisation.
- Visualisations provide clear support for strategic planning across service types.
