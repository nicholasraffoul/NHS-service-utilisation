# NHS Service Utilisation – Data Analysis Project

This repository presents a data exploration project focused on National Health Services (NHS) appointment activity. The main objective is to investigate patterns in appointment types, regional trends, and missed (DNA) appointments, using a combination of visualisation and data wrangling techniques.

The NHS has 106 Sub Integrated Care Board Locations at the primary care level across the UK. The objective was to assess trends in service utilisation, appointment attendance, and the potential value of incorporating social media data into operational decision-making. 

## Project Overview

This project was developed as part of a data analytics course to explore service utilisation in the NHS. It includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visual outputs that highlight key insights related to how different services are accessed and missed across the UK.

### Files and Folders

- `NHS-Data-Exploration-Jupyter-Notebook.ipynb` – Contains the full analysis process from import to insights.
- `data/` – Folder containing CSV and Excel files of NHS data used in the project.
- `README.md` – This document.
- (Optional) `figures/` – Store for generated charts and plots.

## Goals of the Analysis

- Understand service demand across regions and categories.
- Identify trends in appointment attendance and DNA rates.
- Highlight seasonal patterns and monthly changes in service use.
- Use visual tools to communicate trends to a non-technical audience.

## Tools Used

- **Python** (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib)
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## Summary of Findings

- Consistent underutilisation indicates that the NHS may be operating below its true potential, likely due to limited staff availability, burnout or system inefficiencies.
- Missed appointment trend: A steady 4–5% of appointments were marked as "Did Not Attend" (DNA), accounting for around one million missed appointments each month across NHS locations. This persistent non-attendance represents a potential area for service improvement through reminder systems or targeted patient engagement.
